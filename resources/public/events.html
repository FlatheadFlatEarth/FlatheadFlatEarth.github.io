On both the globe and flat earth, this is the date that the sun appears to be most northerly in the sky. As such, this is a unique opportunity for us to measure the sun's position in the sky.<br /><br />We'll get better results by performing this experiment exactly on the Solstice on June 21, but we are hosting a public trial on June 19, so that more can attend. We may run the experiment again on the Solstice in order to get a better result.<br /><br />US Army Field Artilleryman Corey Kell famously performed this experiment 80 times while overseas in Afghanistan. His findings have found that the heliocentric, globe model of the universe is woefully inaccurate in predicting the position of the sun in the sky.<br /><br />We plan to replicate his experiment in order to gather additional primary evidence that the globe model of the universe is not the correct one.<br /><br />The logistics are still coming together for this one. We'll need to identify a suitable location from which to perform our observations. Stay tuned.</p></div><div class="cell small-4">Presenters: <div class="cell small-2"><div>David Kay</div><img height="50" src="/img/presenters/dk.jpg" width="50" /></div><div class="cell small-2"><div>Athanasius</div><img height="50" src="/img/presenters/athanasius.jpg" width="50" /></div></div><div class="cell"><div><span><span class="pairLabel">Venue:</span> TBD</span></div><div><span><span class="pairLabel">Address:</span> <a href="https://maps.google.com/?q="></a></span></div><div><span><span class="pairLabel">Details:</span> Venue to be determined.</span></div></div><div class="cell"><span><span class="pairLabel">Fee:</span> Free</span></div></div><div class="grid-x event"><div class="cell small-8"><h3>We Can See Too Far</h3></div><div class="grid-y small-4"><div class="cell"><span class="label primary">Presentation</span></div><div class="cell"><span><span class="pairLabel">Date:</span> July 22, 2023</span></div><div class="cell"><span><span class="pairLabel">Time:</span> 18:00 - 20:00</span></div></div><div class="cell small-8 eventDescription"><p><span class="pairLabel">Description: </span><br />In our second presentation, we'll be discussing one of the most easily-observable indications that the Earth is not a globe: we can see too far.<br /><br />One common argument in favor of the globe is that of 'ships disappearing over the horizon.' Unfortunately for the globers, this argument can be falsified through the use of a high-powered telescope. Indeed, ships that have 'disappeared' over the horizon can often be restored to view by use of high magnification. Despite most globe believers telling you that this effect is due to atmospheric refraction, we can demonstrate that this claim does not hold up to close scrutiny.<br /><br />In this talk, we will compare the expected versus the actual results when seeking to detect Earth's curvature, as well as the underlying principles at play. Moreover, David has performed this experiment in the field and will share from his experience.<br /><br />Given that we live along the shores of one of the largest lakes in the US, we have the opportunity to practice this experiment in our backyard.

How can it be that Baumgartner only traveled a distance of X while the Earth was spinning below him at speeds greater than 800 miles per hour?<br /><br />Secondly, we can investigate the camera footage: the so-called 'globe footage' from this jump is invalidated by several things, including the words of Neil deGrasse Tyson himself.<br /><br />We will closely investigate the above claims and conclude that the Red Bull Stratos Jump not only falls short in proving the globe, but provides concrete evidence invalidating the globe model.<br /><br />Schedule:<br /><br />6PM - Doors Open<br />6:15PM - Presentation Begins<br />7:15PM - Q&A<br />Afterwards - Social hour</p></div><div class="cell small-4">Presenters: <div class="cell small-2"><div>David Kay</div><img height="50" src="/img/presenters/dk.jpg" width="50" /></div><div class="cell small-2"><div>Athanasius</div><img height="50" src="/img/presenters/athanasius.jpg" width="50" /></div></div><div class="cell"><div><span><span class="pairLabel">Venue:</span> <a href="https://branniganspub.com/">Brannigan's Pub</a></span></div><div><span><span class="pairLabel">Address:</span> <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/9tM5YkdrskT2ujYu6">101 E Center St, Kalispell, MT 59901</a></span></div><div><span><span class="pairLabel">Details:</span> Library Room (first floor)</span></div></div><div class="cell"><span><span class="pairLabel">Fee:</span> Free, but Brannigan's will only continue to host us if we are a profitable customer for them; please order food & drink to your heart's content.</span></div></div><div class="grid-x event"><div class="cell small-8"><h3>Flat Earth: A Model</h3></div><div class="grid-y small-4"><div class="cell"><span class="label primary">Presentation</span></div><div class="cell"><span><span class="pairLabel">Date:</span> October 16, 2023</span></div><div class="cell"><span><span class="pairLabel">Time:</span> 18:00 - 20:00</span></div></div><div class="cell small-8 eventDescription"><p><span class="pairLabel">Description: </span><br />Now that we have disproven several of the high-profile deceptions which support the globe, we are going to spend some time outlining an explanatory model for how the Earth and celestial bodies may actually behave, based on real-world observation.<br /><br />The description of the earth as a disc under a dome was embraced by many ancient cultures.
